Python Typing Game

Choose your 'words.txt' file from the 'Languages' folder and move it to the same directory as the 'game.py' file. Then remove '()' from the text file and after that it name should be 'words.txt'. Note that his program uses automatic language detection, which may sometimes fail and show other language on top of the game than it really is.

# Rules:
Type only the words that has green color and underline on them. If you type the words correctly you get points. And if you type the words wrong you lose health. You can fail 5 times before the game ends.
